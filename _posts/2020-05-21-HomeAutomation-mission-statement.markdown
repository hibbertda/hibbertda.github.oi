I have had the dream of Home Automation for years. 

In all of the time I have developed my own personal mission statement. The mission statement boils down to the mindset I use when implementing new devices in services to further the dream of a fully automated home. My goals and mission boils down to two words:
<br>
<br>
## <center>JUST WORK!</center>

<br>

I don't mind tinkering around making different peices fit together to solve a problem. And If I end up breaking something that is my fault and I will take lumps. BUT I need to trust that when my wife or kids hit a button that installed, it has to work.

#### Cloud Connected Services

All around the home automation communities a common theme is often hate and mistrust about services that require access to back-end resources hosted in the cloud. 

#### Protocol(s)

Z-Wave / ZigBee / Wifi / ETC all begin on equal footing.
